# Diamond Prices Analysis and Prediction

## Project Description
This project explores factors affecting diamond prices using the DiamondsPrices dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to estimate diamond prices based on attributes like carat, cut, clarity, and color.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about diamonds, including features such as:
- `Carat`: Weight of the diamond.
- `Cut`: Quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium).
- `Color`: Diamond color grading.
- `Clarity`: Measurement of inclusions and blemishes.
- `Price`: Price in US dollars.

## Key Features
- Visualizations to explore trends and patterns in diamond prices.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for missing values and categorical encoding.
- Regression models for predicting diamond prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
- Dataset: DiamondsPrices.csv
